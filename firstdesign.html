        <h5 class="heading">What is Event Handler ?</h5>
        <p class="content">Event handling in React is the process of responding to user <strong>interactions</strong>
            with React components.
            It involves setting up event listeners, which detect and respond to certain events like <strong>mouse
                clicks, touches, key presses, etc</strong> . React makes it easy to handle events with its
            <strong>SyntheticEvent system</strong> ,
            which normalizes events across browsers and provides a consistent interface for handling them.

            <li>Event handlers can be used to trigger changes in the component’s state.</li>
            <li>React’s event system allows for easy debugging and testing of events.</li>
